# Cavity-Flow
--navierstokes eqns. mass and mom, pressure and velocity coupling.

In this program a cavity flow has been studied. Its a well known problem in computational fluid dynamics.

Mass conservation and momentum equations with all terms of transient, diffusion, source term, and convection terms has been applied. PIS method has been used for convection term.
It has more than 30 functions which are in 5 seprated files.

main files: Initialization - grid generations - side functions - main functions - main program.
